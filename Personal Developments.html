                                Receiving constructive criticism at work is helpful because it shows that your managers and 
                                co-workers care about your work and want you to succeed. 
                                However, hearing negative feedback can be tough for some people and it may cause them to become defensive or feel offended.

                                Having the ability to accept criticism and view it as someone else genuinely trying to reach out to help you is a strength 
                                that shows your potential employer that you are open to learning new things and always want to have a chance to improve.

                                Having time management skills allows you to properly prioritize your work,<br>
                                 estimate how long each task will take, and complete your work in an orderly 
                                 fashion so you can finish more tasks in a shorter period of time. 
                                 This helps open up more free time, which then gives you opportunities to either do more projects, 
                                 engage in learning opportunities, reduce your stress, or increase your focus.

                              There was only a minimal instance of development in regards to managing my time better. However minimal it was, it has came in real handy

                                Observation skills refer to the ability to use all five of your senses to recognize, analyze and recall your surroundings. 
                                This practice is often associated with mindfulness because it encourages me to be present and aware of the details of my daily life.

                               I think over a lifetime I got naturally observant of surroundings, details and seeing patterns. A factor could be from me being a bit more
                               reserved and slow to speak. The chance for having a clearer observation is to set aside distraction and paying attention more.
