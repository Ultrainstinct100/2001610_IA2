                                <p>Hi, my name is David Walker, a twenty years old young boy living in Kingston, St.Andrew, Jamaica.
                                <br>Currently, I am attending The University Of Technology at the Papine Campus where I study to become a Computer Programmer and Technician.
                                <br>Growing up, there was a time I had been curious to know what the inside of a Computer Tower was like.
                                <br>We have all used it to connect USB chord, flash drives, thumb drives, inserted Compacted Disks into CD Driver and so on.
                                <br>These things intrigued me to find out what was beneath the surface of what we have been using for so long.
                                <br>Not just pulling the various peripherals apart but also putting back together sparked my aspirition.</p>
                                
                                <section>
                                <p>The sports of basketball holds a close place in my heart, as it is a sport I had never known I would like to play.
                                <br>Once I got the oppotunity to partake in the sport, I discovered that I could shoot very well without any training.
                                <br>Though there was a long time before I joined a professional school team, I had soon seen how great discipline was to become better at
                                <br>playing the sport and playing better to help a team win was was something I liked.</p>

                                <p>This test was basically spot on I believe. People would many times wonder if I am <q>ok</q> due to me being so quiet and withdrawn.
                                I am not someone who is talkitve and in turn I tend to take note with what is happening around me. This is my nature to be introverted.
                                However, trusting is not a trait of mine. One of the reasons I am probably introverted is to the fact that trusting others is difficult.
                                Why you may ask? It is just that through observation I understand others can be one person here and at another time and place they are no 
                                longer as such. I often feel anxious around new and unfamiliar around others but still does not attempt to socialise with others.  
                                When I worry, I tend to do so long before the something is to happen even creating potential unnecessary scenarios in my mind.</p>
